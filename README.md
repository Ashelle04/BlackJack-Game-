Code Highlights
Hint 4: deal_card()
python
Copy code
def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  return random.choice(cards)
Hint 5: Dealing Cards
python
Copy code
user_cards = []
computer_cards = []

for _ in range(2):
  user_cards.append(deal_card())
  computer_cards.append(deal_card())
Hint 6 & 7: calculate_score()
python
Copy code
def calculate_score(cards):
  if len(cards) == 2 and sum(cards) == 21:
    return 0  
  elif 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
    cards.remove(11)
    cards.append(1)
  return sum(cards)
Game Loop
python
Copy code
game_over = False 

while not game_over:
  # User's turn
  user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
  if user_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
    game_over = True 
  else:
    need_card = input('Press "y" to hit, press "n" to finish')
    if need_card == "y":
      user_cards.append(deal_card())
    else:
      game_over = True

  # Computer's turn
  computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
  while computer_score < 17:
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)

# Compare scores
compare(user_score, computer_score)
Hint 13: compare()
python
Copy code
def compare(user_score, computer_score):
  # Comparison logic
  # ...
